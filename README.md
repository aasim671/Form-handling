Form handling using php


This repository contains a simple PHP script demonstrating form submission handling using the Post/Redirect/Get (PRG) pattern. 
The script processes form data submitted via POST method, displays an alert message upon successful submission,
and redirects the user to a success page to avoid form resubmission upon page refresh. 
This approach enhances user experience by preventing duplicate form submissions and ensuring smoother navigation within the web application.
